### Important
---
- There are three merchants, one for each type of item: weapons, ammo, and items.
- Up to three merchants can spawn on a map. They have a different inventory each time, meaning some items may be missing.
- Escorting the merchants to the exit will give you a 20% boost per merchant to whatever money you have earned, but will also remove them from the map, meaning they will no longer be there in the case of hubs. They can still spawn on the next map, however. In multiplayer games, the distance to the arbitrator (usually team leader) is taken into account, and not whoever exited the level. To escort all merchants in multiplayer, have all of them near the arbitrator, then exit the level.
- You can carry the merchant by using Sprinting + Use. Put them down by crouching. You can only carry one merchant at a time.

### Notes
---
- Change between currencies using the Page Up/Down keys.
- Change between categories using the Left/Right arrow keys, and between items with the Up/Down arrow keys
- Some enemies will not reward cash for killing them. Putti and Lost Souls in particular.
- Loadout code for the mercenary bucks is `bux`.

### Slot Machines
---
Why play when you can gamble? Machines spawn in secret sectors, much like merchants, and cost 10 7mm rounds to roll. Hold Sprint when pressing Use to insert +10 rounds for a higher reward.
Payouts are as follows:
- 1 Stim = x1
- 2 Stims = x2.5
- 3 Stims = x5
- 3 Medkits = x10
- 3 Potions = x25
- 3 Spiritual Armors = x50
- 3 Megaspheres = x75
- 3 Butts = x125
- 3 Precious = x200

### Modding
---
- Sectors with the custom UDMF property `user_merchantsector` set to `1` will always spawn a merchant.

### Known Issues
---
- Merchant can block some paths. Grab them or pick them up to move them out of the way.
